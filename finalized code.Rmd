# Introduction

Every day we rely upon our utilities to provide us with electricity and gas on-demand. But what do you know about your utility? How well is it doing its job, relative to the other utilities in the U.S.? 

This report is aimed towards answering your basic questions about utilities. We're also making all of the resources used to produce this report available to the public so that anyone can replicate the report, whether to explore a different state or to update it with newer data. 

# Methodology

This report relies on publicly available data, primarily data gathered and published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and also data from the U.S. Census and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

One of the major goals of this report is for it to be fully transparent and repeatable. As such, we cite sources directly on each figure. We have also uploaded a ReadMe file with more details on the methodology of this report and all data and code used to produce it onto CUB WI’s github repository at https://github.com/CUBWI/2023-Utility-Report-Card. You can reach us through our website for any further questions: www.cubwi.org.

# Reliability

One of the objectives of this report is to compare the reliability of the utilities tasked with serving electricity and natural gas to customers across the U.S. The following charts do just that, beginning with the reliability of utility electricity distribution systems and proceeding to the reliability of utility natural gas distribution systems.

## Electric Power

The report’s first set of charts shows how utilities compare in terms of reliability. We present three “interruption indices,” the System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), the System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), and the Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI).

### Background on Metrics

A utility calculates SAIDI, SAIFI, and CAIDI for each “nonmomentary outage” that occurs on its system.\footnote{The IEEE defines a nonmomentary outage as one that lasts for five minutes or longer.} The EIA then publishes annual metrics from the utility data, representing the sum of each metric across a calendar year. The charts below present these annual figures (See our ReadMe for further information on the IEEE standard and details on these interruption indices)

For a single nonmomentary outage, CAIDI measures the duration, in minutes, of the outage, and SAIFI measures the proportion of a system’s customers affected by the outage. SAIDI is the product of CAIDI and SAIFI. As such, the sum of annual SAIDI values for a utility represents, in a single number, its reliability for that year. We therefore present SAIDI first, followed by its components, SAIFI and CAIDI.

The indices presented are split between those that are “without Major Event Days” and those that are “with Major Event Days.” Major Event Days (MEDs) are days on which the total SAIDI value for that day is so high as to be considered an outlier. MEDs are an attempt to account for outages caused by things beyond the control of a utility, for example, a major weather event such as a tornado (Note: because the MED threshold is calculated using the past 5 years of data, if a utility’s region consistently has bad weather and the utility fails to adjust to that, for example by failing to bury electricity polls underground, the outages caused by that weather will eventually fall below the MED threshold - again, see our ReadMe file for more details). As such, SAIDI without MEDs presents the reliability of an electricity grid during day-to-day operations.

Because SAIDI without MEDs represents the reliability of a utility’s electric grid on an average day, we believe that, compared to SAIDI with MEDs, it better indicates how well utilities are meeting their obligations to their customers. As such, we present the “without MED” charts first. A customer may be more interested, though, in understanding how their own outage experience overall compares to other states or to major Wisconsin utilities, so we provide the “with MEDs” charts next.

### Excluding Alternative Measurement Standards

Some utilities use standards other than the IEEE for calculating reliability metrics. The EIA data lacks the information necessary to discern how, precisely, an alternative standard differs from the IEEE standard. For this reason, reliability metrics published under alternative standards are not directly comparable to IEEE standard. As such, in all but one case (see below) we have chosen to remove non-IEEE standard data from the following charts.

### Wisconsin Power & Light

Wisconsin Power & Light is included in the following charts despite the fact that it does not use the IEEE standard. According to staff at WP&L, the utility calculates nonmomentary outages as described above (i.e. any outage longer than five minutes is nonmomentary) but follows the Iowa Utility Board’s (IUB) definition for a “Major event” (Iowa Administrative Code 199 §20.18(4))\footnote{This reads, in part: “Major event” will be declared whenever extensive physical damage to transmission and distribution facilities has occurred within an electric utility’s operating area due to unusually severe and abnormal weather or event and:
1. Wind speed exceeds 90 mph for the affected area, or
2. One-half inch of ice is present and wind speed exceeds 40 mph for the affected area, or
3. Ten percent of the affected area total customer count is incurring a loss of service for a length of time to exceed five hours, or
4. 20,000 customers in a metropolitan area are incurring a loss of service for a length of time to exceed five hours.
}, which differs from the IEEE’s “Major Event Day” standard. Still, while we did not have the data necessary to compare the two standards, staff said that the results of the two standards are similar.

Because the only difference between the two standards is the definition of MED, WP&L’s metrics with MEDs are directly comparable to the other utilities’ metrics with MEDs. However, readers should be mindful when comparing WP&L’s metrics without MEDs to other utilities’ metrics without MEDs, since we were not able to quantify the difference between the two standards.

### Takeaways

There are three caveats to consider when looking at the following charts. First, “without MED” values can be correlated with “with MED” values as explained in the following example: Imagine a storm was to occur at 10 pm on Monday and cause widespread outages that ended at 2 am on Wednesday. The 24 hours of outage on Tuesday would likely put Tuesday above the utility’s MED threshold, but both Monday’s and Wednesday’s outages, only two hours each, may not surpass the MED threshold even though they are part of the same event that made Tuesday an MED.

Second, there are likely characteristics inherent to certain electric systems that make them more prone to outages, such as a larger service area. All else equal, a larger service area would mean there are more distribution lines that could face interference from animals, trees, or other things. This could explain why MG&E and Superior (which have smaller service areas) have lower SAIDI values than WEPCO and WP&L. In future reports, we will look to provide metrics that account for such differences in systems and provide a better apples-to-apples comparison.

The final caveat is simply that while there are costs associated with outages, there are also costs associated with maintaining a reliable system. Creating a system that never has outages would be incredibly expensive. When considering how well a utility or a state’s utilities seem to be performing in terms of reliability, it is also worth considering how much the average user pays for that performance.

## Reliability Over Time

We include below six more graphs that provide some historic context for the most recent reliability figures from Wisconsin's publicly-traded utilities. These charts use all of the reliability data currently available, which goes back to 2013. 

### Takeaways

Again, remember that the "Without Major Event Days" and "With Major Event Days" charts are showing related but different things. The "Without Major Event Days" covers how well the utilities have been able to improve how their distribution systems function in their day-to-day operations. From this perspective, customers of the Wisconsin Electric Power Company, for example, would be right to feel worried about the steady increase in interruption frequency and duration that has been occurring since 2017 (this is most visible in the SAIDI graph, but a trend is clear in all three). 

The "With Major Event Days" charts, meanwhile, show how much the distribution systems of these utilities are affected by events beyond their control - what is under their control, of course, is how prepared they are for such events. Still, given the variability of weather in each year, it is difficult to take away any clear narrative from these charts beyond details on the experience of customers over the past several years.

## Natural Gas Systems

These next graphs assess the reliability of a utility’s natural gas distribution system. They do so by showing reported levels of “lost gas” from utilities, which is the amount of natural gas that each utility reported lost as a “natural consequence of distribution activities.” This covers both known and estimated losses and is separate from “unaccounted for gas,” which is the difference between the total reported gas supplied to a utility and the total reported distributed gas for that utility (the latter is referred to as “total disposition”). In fact, when calculating the total disposition, lost gas is included in that total.

This section begins by looking at total lost gas. Given the health and economic
impacts of leaking natural gas, this gross value is important to track. That said, as seen below, there is a clear correlation between high lost gas volumes and having a strong natural gas distribution economy (e.g. Texas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania) and/or a high population (e.g. California, New York).

In an attempt to account for these correlations, the second pair of graphs show what portion of the total disposition of natural gas for a utility comes from that lost gas value.

### Takeaways

One thing that jumps out from these charts is how leaky the distribution system seems to be in the District of Columbia. One possible explanation for this is that DC has zero industrial customers, but a large number of residential customers. Since residential customers do not use nearly the volume of gas that industrial customers use, this might mean that for the volume of gas sold, there is a greater mileage of distribution system in DC than in other states (each resident needs their own connection and each connection could have a leak).

That said, a high leakage rate can also simply indicate poor overall infrastructure. Every leak corresponds to an unnecessary cost that utilities then pass on to customers. For this reason, it is a valuable metric to track.

# Heating Fuel

The following graph uses American Community Survey data to show the heating characteristics of households within different states in the U.S. as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. Survey respondents are asked “Which FUEL is used MOST for heating this house, apartment or mobile home?”

### Takeaways

These data are valuable context for when we move on to charts about the costs of residential gas and electricity. For example, Utah’s households will be more negatively impacted by a rise in gas prices than Florida’s households, all else equal.

Another thing to consider when looking at this graph is that, through the "other" category, it suggests which states have the best opportunity to improve the costs associated with residential heating systems. 

The "other" category is primarily made up of heating oil and bottled gas, such as propane. These are both relatively expensive fuels and while they were previously necessary for households that did not have access to natural gas infrastructure, modern electric heat pumps generally provide cost and emissions savings over heating oil and bottled gas systems. With this in mind, as shown in figure `r j`, states such as Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire have a great opportunity for lower residential heating bills through a transition towards electric heat pumps.

As a cautionary note, the efficiency of heat pumps does not necessarily mean that those states with a high proportion of households heating with electricity are doing so efficiently or cheaply. While heat pumps have efficiency levels high enough to provide cost savings over alternative heating methods, electric resistance heating (i.e. baseboards) is much less efficient. Hopefully, future surveys will distinguish between electric resistance and electric heat pump heating to provide a better sense of the efficiency of a state’s residential heating.

# Electricity Profiles

The following charts provide some basic, electricity-related information on residential households. Included is the amount of electricity used, the total amount spent on electricity, and the average cost of that electricity. Data is provided at the state level and for the 6 publicly-traded Wisconsin utilities. 

Calculating these aggregate numbers correctly from the utility-level data can be tricky, especially for utilities operating in states that allow households to choose their energy providers. Anyone hoping to recreate these charts for their own purposes should look at the ReadMe file available at https://github.com/CUBWI/2023-Utility-Report-Card to ensure they're doing so correctly. 

### Takeaways

What explains the significant jump in electricity cost for the Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) and Madison Gas & Electric (MG&E)? 

The reliability charts indicated that WEPCO had the worst outage performance of all six Wisconsin utilities that we highlighted in 2021. So is it fair that they also have the second highest electricity rate?

Meanwhile, MG&E at least provides reliable power to its residential customers for the rates it charges. But is its good reliability simply a function of its relatively small service footprint? If so, is MG&E overcharging for a level of reliability that is actually relatively cheap for them to provide?

## Electricity Costs Over Time

The following two charts present electricity costs for six Wisconsin IOUs since 2003, first in absolute terms and second as a growth rate (with 2011 as the baseyear for Superior and 2003 as the base year for the other five utilities).
